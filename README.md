# EasyCompound
Makes Compound interactions easy and safe
This is in development and needs to be tested.


The idea is to allow anyone to import this project and use lend to compound by not having to code a line of interaction with the protocol itself.
Users will deposit ether or Dai in Easy_Compound.sol to earn interests, knowing that they will be able to withdraw at any time.
